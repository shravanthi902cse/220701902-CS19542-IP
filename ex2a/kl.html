      Kerala, often referred to as "God's Own Country," is located in the southwestern region of India. 
      The state is renowned for its picturesque landscapes, including palm-lined beaches, serene backwaters, 
      and lush green hills. The backwaters of Kerala, particularly in Alappuzha and Kumarakom, offer unique 
      houseboat cruises that attract tourists from around the world. Kerala has a rich cultural heritage, 
      with classical dance forms like Kathakali, known for its elaborate costumes and storytelling, and 
      Mohiniyattam, which showcases graceful movements. The state is also known for its traditional martial 
      art, Kalaripayattu. Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is widely practiced in Kerala, 
      making it a popular destination for wellness and medical tourism. The state's literacy rate is one of 
      the highest in India, and it has made significant strides in healthcare and education. Kerala's cuisine 
      is diverse and flavorful, with seafood being a staple, along with dishes like appam, puttu, and fish 
      curry. The capital city, Thiruvananthapuram, is a major academic and IT hub, while Kochi is known for 
      its port and vibrant cultural scene. The state's festivals, such as Onam and Vishu, are celebrated with
