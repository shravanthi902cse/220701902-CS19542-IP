  <h2>Telangana</h2>
        <p>
            Telangana, the youngest state in India, was formed in 2014 and is located in the southern part of the country. 
            The state is known for its unique culture that blends Telugu and Persian influences, a legacy of its history as 
            part of the princely state of Hyderabad. Hyderabad, the capital city, is a major IT and pharmaceutical hub, 
            often referred to as "Cyberabad." The city is famous for its historical landmarks, such as the Charminar, Golconda Fort, 
            and the Qutb Shahi Tombs, which reflect its rich architectural heritage. Telangana has a vibrant cultural scene, 
            with traditional dance forms like Perini Sivatandavam and festivals like Bonalu and Bathukamma, which are celebrated 
            with much fervor. The state's cuisine is renowned for its spicy and flavorful dishes, including the iconic Hyderabadi Biryani, 
            Haleem, and a variety of kebabs. Telangana is also known for its diverse landscapes, from the dense forests of the 
            Nallamala Hills to the arid Deccan Plateau. The state has a rich tradition of arts and crafts, including 
            Pochampally ikat weaving, Bidriware, and Cheriyal scroll painting. Telangana's economy is diverse, with strong 
            contributions from agriculture, industry, and services. The state has made significant strides in education and 
            healthcare, with institutions like the Indian School of Business (ISB) and various medical colleges. Telangana is 
            also home to several wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, such as the Kawal and Amrabad Tiger Reserves, which 
            are vital for biodiversity conservation.
